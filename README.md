# ðŸ‘· JSON-API

Here is one of my project which is basically a linktree like serverless application.

If you make a `GET Request` at this url
```
https://json-api.aishwaryasharma8961.workers.dev/links
```
You will get an array of JSON which contains my links.
On the home page of the application there is a list of links and on clicking on any of them it will take you to the corresponding page.


[`index.js`](https://github.com/SharmaAishwarya/MyWorkersProject/blob/master/index.js) is the content of the my Workers script.

#### Deployed Link

My application is also [deployed](https://json-api.aishwaryasharma8961.workers.dev/) on cloudflare under this link.
